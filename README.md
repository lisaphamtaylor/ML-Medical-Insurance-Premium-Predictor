## Introduction

What's My Premium is a health insurance premium prediction model that uses machine learning to predict the cost of health insurance based on a number of factors. The model is trained on a dataset of 1338 entries. This code compares the cross value score and train/test accuracies of different ML models--Linear Regression, Support Vector Machine, Random Forest, Gradient Boost, XGBoost--to identify the best model for prediction.
